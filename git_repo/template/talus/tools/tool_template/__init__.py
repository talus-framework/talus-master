        # A few notes
        # -----------
        # * Tools have a logger at self.log. See the python logging module for
        #   details. (basically, call debug(), info(), warn(), error(), methods
        #   on it to log data)
        #
        # * Tools have a progress(amt=1) method that progress can be reported with.
        #   If progress() is never manually called, it will be called once after the
        #   tool has run.
        #
        # * Tools have result(data) method that can be used to save a job's results
        #
        # * Inheritance works with talus components - e.g. a parameter's type is
        #   Component(ISomething), any component that subclasses ISomething
        #   will be able to be used.
        #
        # * The tool's index into the Job is found at ``self.idx``
        #
        # GOOD LUCK!
